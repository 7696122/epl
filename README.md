EPL â€” Emacs Package Library
===========================

[![License GPL 3][badge-license]][copying]
[![Build Status][badge-travis]][travis]

EPL provides a convenient high-level API for various package.el versions, and
aims to overcome its most striking idiocies.

Installation
------------

Install from [MELPA][] or [Marmalade][].  The former is strongly recommended.

In your [`Cask`][cask]:

```cl
(source gnu)
(source melpa)

(depends-on "epl")
```

EPL supports GNU Emacs 23 with the [3rd party `package.el`][legacy-package], and
GNU Emacs 24 with the built-in `package.el` library.  Other versions of Emacs,
and other flavors of Emacs (e.g. XEmacs, Aquamacs, etc.) are *not* supported.

At the time of writing, Emacs trunk (upcoming Emacs 24.4) is the preferred
version, because its `package.el` is the most advanced and best implemented
version.  Stable GNU Emacs 24 is supported, but limited in features.  GNU Emacs
23 is only supported as long as possible without greater pain.  It may be
dropped any time if obstacles appear.

If you have any choice, use Emacs trunk.

Usage
-----

Refer to the commentary of `epl.el` for a list of functions, and to the
docstrings of these functions for usage instructions.

We may add a list of all functions to this README, but this is not exactly
easy.  Pull requests welcome.
