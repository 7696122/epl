;; Test the `epl-package' and related structures.

;;; Code:

(require 'epl)

(require 'ert)
(require 'pcase)

(ert-deftest epl-package-as-description-needs-symbol ()
  ;; We explicitly `eval' the expression here, to avoid eager macro expansion
  ;; kicking in, and triggering the error before the test gets executed
  (pcase-let* ((expr '(epl-package-as-description "foo"
                        (message "bar")))
               (`(,err . ,data) (should-error (eval expr)))
               (`(,predicate ,value) data))
    (should (eq err 'wrong-type-argument))
    (should (eq predicate #'symbolp))
    (should (equal value "foo"))))
